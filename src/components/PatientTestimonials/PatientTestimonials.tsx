Dr. Matt listened carefully to my concerns and did a great job of explaining what he was doing and why at every step along the way so I understood what was happening. After one session, I felt immediate pain relief from back issues that had been bothering me so much I was having a hard time sitting still. After several sessions, I\'m getting continuous improvement on a neck injury that i\'ve had for years and years. I very highly recommend Dr. Matt, both for his super friendly and helpful manner, and for the results!'}

          bodyText={'I have been seeing Dr. Bentley for a little over 6 months now and I have nothing but good things to say about his practice. I am a martial artist of 17 years, and I plan to continue practicing martial arts for the rest of my life. My goal is to keep my body healthy, so I can do my sport for as long as possible. Chiropractic care with Dr. Bentley has been hugely beneficial to my health in the last 6 months.\n\nA main priority for me is to make sure I understand the treatment that my body is going through. Dr. Bentley is really great at explaining his technique, thought process, and the science behind it all. I feel that my body has responded really well over the last 6 months. Improvements that I have seen are decreased pain, increased mobility, and increased mind muscle connection. I feel that my body is less prone to injury lately, but I am also able to recover quicker if I do get a minor injury. Highly recommend adding Dr. Bentley to your health regimen!'}
